GuessingGame App
This is the first project collection from the book: Learn Java the Easy Way. This game is written in Java with simple GUI interface.
The Guessing Game app works simply by prompting the user for the correct number. If the user enters the right number, it will display the message that the user wins the game on the screen.
Otherwise, continue guessing until the user reaches the correct number.
